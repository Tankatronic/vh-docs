# Document Library

The VendorHub Document Library is a Document Management System designed to be flexible and used in modern applications. Documents can be uploaded through various channels, stored on many mediums, organized, augmented with metadata, searched, and retrieved through the Document Library.

The Document Library deviates from traditional document management systems in a few key areas:

- Documents are not required to relocate into the Document Library to take advantage of the provided features and services.
- Managed accounts provide the ability for external organizations to access their private Document Library while being managed by the primary account.
- There are multiple methods of interacting with the Document Library, including a Web Browser or SFTP client.
- Document Library is an API-first product, meaning that all features are accessible by any custom software or integration.

These key areas, along with many others, set the VendorHub Document Library apart from other document management systems. Together they provide a compelling use case in the enterprise for collecting, storing, and retrieving all types of documents.
